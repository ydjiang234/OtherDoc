\section*{Description}
This document aims to guide users to install and run Abaqus 2017 on a Linux machine. Table \ref{tb-1} summarizes the installation environments used in this guidance. Although Ubuntu is specified in the table, this instruction file is also suitable for installation of Abaqus on other Linux distributions (e.g. Archlinux, Fedora, etc.). The Linux desktop environment is not required. All installation steps are completed in terminal. Thus, this document is also suitable for users who want to install and run Abaqus on a Linux server remotely via SSH connection. Furthermore, if you want to install other version of Abaqus, you can still follow the methods given by this guide. But it should be highlighted that the administration right is required to complete the installation.

\begin{table}[h!]

\end{table}

\section*{Prerequirments}
\subsection*{Installation Files}
The Abaqus installation files should be transferred to the Linux machine. In this document, the root directory of the installation files is marked \ifp. It should be noted that the \ifp\ should not contain any ``space''.

To avoid any permission issues, the permission of \ifp should be modified so that every user read/write/execute the installation files. To achieve this, simply run the following command in terminal.

\cmd{sudo chmod -R 777 \ifp}

\subsection*{Install Required Packages}
The Linux Abaqus installation program is based on ksh and the FLEXNET requires the lsb-core. The two packages should be installed before the installation of Abaqus by the following command:

\cmd{sudo apt-get install ksh lsb-core}

It should be noted that ``apt-get'' is the package handling utility of Ubuntu. If you are working with other Linux distribution, the command to install packages may vary.

\subsection*{Disguise Your Linux Distribution}
When the Abaqus installation program starts, it will check your Linux release name. If your Linux distribution is not ``Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server'', ``Red Hat Enterprise Linux Client'', ``Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation'', ``Cent OS''or ``Suse Linux'', the program will pop out error and exit, as shown in Figure \ref{fig-1}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/UnknowLinux.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Unknown linux release}
\label{fig-1}
\end{figure}

To avoid this error, you have to disguise your Linux distribution as one of the aforementioned release names. The Abaqus installation program calls a script named ``Linux.sh'' to detect your Linux release name. In this file, you have to change the line ``DSY\_OS\_Release =`lsb\_release --short --id |sed 's/ //g'`'' to ``DSY\_OS\_Release=``CentOS'''', as shown in Figure \ref{fig-2}. In the terminal, you can edit text script file with software ``nano'' or ``vim''. By modifying the ``Linux.sh'' script, the installation program will detect your Linux release name as ``Cent OS''.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/FakeLinux.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Change the ``Linux.sh'' file}
\label{fig-2}
\end{figure}

There are eight ``Linux.sh'' scripts in the \ifp, you need to modify all the eight files. The directories which contain the scripts are listed in Table \ref{tb-2}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\end{table}

\section*{Installation}
First of all, login as root user before the installation. In Ubuntu, you can do this by:

\cmd{sudo -s}

To start the installation program, the following command should be executed:

\cmd{\ifp/1/StartTUI.sh}

This command will start a installation program in terminal. Alternatively, if you have Linux with Desktop Environment installed, you can call the following command to start the installation program with a GUI.

\cmd{\ifp/1/StartGUI.sh}

It should be highlighted that you cannot start the installation program from the \ifp\ or its subdirectories. You can switch your current directory with ``cd'' command.

When the installation program starts, you can select and install the SIMULIA products. To install Abaqus, the products ``FLEXnet License Server'', ``Abaqus Simulation Services'', ``Abaqus Simulation Services CAA API'' and ``Abaqus/CAE'' are necessary.

It should be noted that the ``FLEXnet License Server'' should be installed before installing the ``Abaqus/CAE''. When install the ``FLEXnet License Server'', you need to tick the option ``Files only :  do not start the license server program. 
''. When ``FLEXnet License Server'' is installed, you need to start the FLEXnet Server before starting installing ``Abaqus/CAE''. To achieve this, you need to open a new terminal window (or a new SSH connection) and start server with the following command (if you install the ``FLEXnet License Server'' into the default directory).

\cmd{/usr/SIMULIA/License/2017/linux\_a64/code/bin/lmgrd}

During the installation of ``Abaqus/CAE'', the ``SIMULIA FLEXnet'' should be ticked as the license server. The license server of NUI Galway is ``27004@cert1.srv.nuigalway.ie''. 

After the installation, the Abaqus licence type should be changed from academic to research. To do this, one of the Abaqus environment files, ``custom\_v6.env'', should be modified. If the Abaqus is installed into its default directory, the file can be edit with ``nano'' or ``vim''.

\cmd{nano /usr/DassaultSystemes/SimulationServices/V6R2017x/linux\_a64/SMA/site/\\custom\_v6.env}

The line ``academic=TEACHING'' in the ``custom\_v6.env'' file should be commented or deleted, as shown in Figure \ref{fig-3}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Custom_v6.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Change the license setting in the ``custom\_v6.env'' file}
    \label{fig-3}
\end{figure}

After finishing the installation, exit the root mode with command ``exit''.

\section*{Start Abaqus}
If Abaqus is installed into its default directory, it can be called with command:

\cmd{/var/DassaultSystemes/SIMULIA/Commands/abaqus}

To avoid typing the full path to start Abaqus, the path ``/var/DassaultSystemes/SIMULIA\\/Commands'' needs to be appended to the ``PATH'' variable of Linux. The system ``PATH'' variable is defined in the file ``/etc/environment''. Open the file with ``nano'' or ``vim'' and append the Abaqus command path into the ``PATH'' variable, as shown in Figure \ref{fig-4}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/AppendPath.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Append path to ``PATH'' variable}
    \label{fig-4}
\end{figure}

After modifying the ``/etc/environment'' file, a reboot or re-login is required to take the modification into effects. Now the Abaqus can be simply called by:

\cmd{abaqus}

The Abaqus CAE can be started by:

\cmd{abaqus cae}

It should be noted that other libraries (e.g. libstdc++.so.6, libjpeg62, etc.) may be required by Abaqus CAE. Just follow the error message given by Abaqus CAE and install the missing libraries with ``apt-get''.
